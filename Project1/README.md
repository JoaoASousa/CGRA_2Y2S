- [x] On Plane XZ and Centered on the Origin
- [x] Variable number of sides
- [x] Vertices 
- [x] Indexes
- [x] Normals
- [x] Texture

<h4>1.2 MySphere - Sphere</h4>

- [x] Add Texture

<h4>1.3 Cube Map - Creation of a cubemap for the ambient</h4>

- [ ] ...

<h4>1.4 MyVehicle - Preliminary Version</h4>

<h3>2. Interface</h3>

- [ ] 3.
- [ ] 4.

<h4>2.2 Additional Interface Controls</h4>

- [ ] 2. slider in GUI named speedFactor (between 0.1 and 3) that multiplies the value of the displacement's speed each time the "W" or the "S" key is pressed
- [x] 3. slider in GUI named scaleFactor (between 0.5 and 3) that allow scaling of the vehicle to facilitate animation observing
